# The line below generates a random number between 1 and 10.
number <- sample(1:10,1)
# Get R to find out if the value is even
# Hint: we do this using the modulo operator, the statment should be (number%%2==0)

# Write a conditional that prints 'Even Number' or 'Odd Number' depending upon the
# value of 'number'

# Write a conditional that evaluates the conditional code block if the first statement
# is FALSE

# Create a conditional block that will check first to see if the number is prime, returing
# 'Prime' if true, before checking if the number is odd or even.
# Hint: you will require a vector of primes up to 10 and the %in% operator

# Nest a conditional that checks if the number is greater than or equal to 5. If so return
# 'Large Odd Number', 'Small Odd Number' etc.

# Un-nest the above conditional as we should only nest if we are evaluating different
# variables from the "parent" conditional
